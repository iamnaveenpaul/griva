# Getting started

### Prerequisites

> if you don't know what you are doing go on the website and follow the instructions, those are pretty straight forward

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Angular-CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/petr166/mean-chat-app.git

# change into the repo directory
cd mean-chat-app

# !! create .env file with the model from .env.example !!

# install server dependencies
npm install

# change into the angular src directory
cd angular-src

# install frontend dependencies
npm install

# start the server
cd ../ && npm run dev

# in another terminal window
cd <App folder>/angular-src && npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:4200 in your browser.

# Technologies

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript backend/server-side solution of choice

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node framework that makes handling http requests with ease

  - [JsonWebToken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - package that helps with generating JWTs for secure authentication

  - [PassportJS](http://passportjs.org/) - authentication middleware used to guard certain parts of the app for non-authenticated requests

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - data storage solution that just speaks JSON and pairs very well with Node

  - [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - package that helps with object modeling and manages connection between server and database

  - [Bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) - for salting and hashing the user password to be stored in the database

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - web sockets implementation, fast and reliable real-time communication engine

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - rich frontend web framework, helps creating fast, reliable web applications

  - [Angular-CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) - command line interface for streamlined angular development

  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - superset of JavaScript that can be compiler-checked, also has types!!

  - [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/) - JavaScript date/time parser

  - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS/JS framework, makes it easy to develop responsive, well polished web apps

# How it works

On the client-side users can create accounts that will be stored in the database. Then users can authenticate with the given credentials, if those are correct the server sends a unique token to the client. The client stores it for use on restricted backend route requests.

Once authenticated, the server creates a socket bidirectional connection with the client to facilitate the chat functionality.

Every time a user sends a message, this goes to the server which redirects it to the desired respondent. Also every time a user enters or leaves chat, the server announces all the connected clients.

# Motivation

This is a personal project with the purpose of better understanding the client-server communication paradigm, new web technologies, especially Angular :)
